# Plataforma Rural - PTAP Monitoring and Automation

## Project Overview
Welcome to the **Plataforma Rural** repository! This project focuses on the **monitoring and automation of drinking water treatment plants (PTAPs)** in the rural areas of **Santiago de Cali, Colombia**. The platform leverages **IoT technologies**, **real-time data visualization**, and an **interactive frontend** to ensure efficient water quality management and infrastructure optimization.

## Features
- **Sensor Integration:** Real-time data acquisition from multiple PTAPs, including flow rates, pressure, water levels, and quality metrics (pH, turbidity, conductivity, etc.).
- **IoT-based Data Management:** Robust backend for processing, storing, and transmitting critical sensor data.
- **Interactive Frontend:** A user-friendly interface for real-time monitoring, control, and analytics.
- **Scalability:** Modular design to integrate additional plants or features in the future.
- **Compliance:** Adheres to local technical and regulatory standards for water quality monitoring.

## Initial Commit
This repository includes the **base code** for:
- Sensor control and data acquisition.
- IoT data integration.
- A prototype of the frontend interface.

The initial implementation is guided by **technical and contractual requirements** to meet the objectives of the project.

## Technologies
- **Programming Language:** Python
- **Framework:** Dash (Plotly)
- **Database:** PostgreSQL
- **IoT Integration:** MQTT/HTTP protocols
- **Frontend:** React.js components within Dash framework
- **Deployment:** Dockerized for scalability

## Getting Started
1. **Clone the Repository:**
